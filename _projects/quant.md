In a number of applications involving classification, the final goal is not determining which class individual unlabelled instances belong to, but `estimating the prevalence of each class` in the unlabelled data. In recent years it has been pointed out that, in these cases, it would make sense to `directly optimise machine learning algorithms for this goal` rather than just optimising the classifierâ€™s ability to label individual instances. The task of training estimators of class prevalence via supervised learning is known as learning to quantify, or, more simply, quantification.
