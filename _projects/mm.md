This line of research is focused on the representation and processing of multilingual data by multimodal models. We create datasets and benchmarks, such as Multi30K, MaRVL, IGLUE, and FoodieQA with an increasing focus on data that is representative and created by the speakers of diverse languages. From a modelling perspective, we have created the mUNITER, xUNITER, TD-MML, and PAELLA models.
